# Machine Learning for Trading
This project implemented machine learning based trading strategies including the algorithmic steps from information gathering to market orders. The focus was on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. It considered statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.
